# work-day-planner

## Description

I have created a calendar for your work day! By creating this calendar i learned how to use day.js effectively and how to save something to local storage. Now i have a calendar to use during my day job as a sales rep. This will allow me to stay organized and not forget important tasks. 


## Usage
